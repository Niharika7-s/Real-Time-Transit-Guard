# Quick Fix Guide - RTG Vendor App

## âœ… ISSUES FIXED

### 1. Backend Connection Issue
- **Problem**: Flutter app couldn't connect to localhost:3000 from Android emulator
- **Solution**: Added dual URL support (localhost + 10.0.2.2) with automatic fallback
- **Result**: App now connects to backend from both desktop and emulator

### 2. UI Overflow Issue  
- **Problem**: RenderFlex overflow by 61 pixels in recommendation cards
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased card height from 150px to 180px
  - Reduced card width from 180px to 160px
  - Made image height smaller (80px â†’ 70px)
  - Reduced button size and spacing
  - Used Flexible widget for text overflow
- **Result**: No more overflow errors

### 3. Add-to-Cart Functionality
- **Problem**: Missing add-to-cart buttons for recommended products
- **Solution**: Added instant add-to-cart buttons with icons
- **Result**: Click any recommended product â†’ instantly added to cart
