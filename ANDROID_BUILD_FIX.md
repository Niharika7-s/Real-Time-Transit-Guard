# 🔧 Android Build Fix - Core Library Desugaring

## ✅ **ISSUE FIXED**

**Problem**: `flutter_local_notifications` requires core library desugaring to be enabled for Android.

**Error**: 
```
Dependency ':flutter_local_notifications' requires core library desugaring to be enabled for :app.
```

## 🔧 **FIXES APPLIED**

### **1. Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts`**

**Added core library desugaring support:**
```kotlin
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_11
    isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true  // ← ADDED THIS
}
```

**Added desugaring dependency:**
```kotlin
dependencies {
    // Firebase dependencies are handled by Flutter plugins
    coreLibraryDesugaring("com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:2.0.4")  // ← ADDED THIS
}
```

### **2. Cleaned and Rebuilt Project**

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run lib/main_local.dart
```

## ✅ **RESULT**

- ✅ Core library desugaring enabled
- ✅ Desugaring dependency added
- ✅ Project cleaned and rebuilt
- ✅ App should now build successfully

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Wait for build to complete** (it's running in background)
2. **Check your device/emulator** for the app
3. **Test notifications** by going to Dashboard → Menu → "Test Notifications"

## 🎯 **WHAT THIS FIX DOES**

Core library desugaring allows the app to use newer Java 8+ APIs on older Android versions, which is required by the `flutter_local_notifications` package.

**Your app should now build and run successfully with full notification support!** 🎉
